# Python Math Libraries
A collection of small Python modules related to various branches of mathematics, mostly to check my University homework (and to be used in some of my projects).

## `malib.py` -- mathematical analysis
- polynomials
	- +/-/*
	- roots (real and complex)
	- n-th derivatives and integrals
- Taylor series
- TODO: polynomial division

## `lalib` -- linear algebra
- matrices
	- +/-/*
	- symmetry, (positive) definiteness
	- inverse
	- transposition
	- magnitude, normalization (for vectors)
	- orthogonalization
	- characteristic polynomial
- TODO: eigenvalues and eigenvectors

## `dmlib` -- distrete mathematics
- subsets
- relations
	- reflexivity, (anti-)symmetry, transitivity
	- equivalence, ordering
